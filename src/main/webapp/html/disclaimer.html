      <strong>ONLINE APPLICATION DISCLAIMER</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to and use of these web pages, or any other linked web sites provided by BIS AG and/or any affiliate or
      branch of BIS AG ("
      <strong>BIS</strong>"), and any content herein, including posted documents, ("Materials") is subject to the
      following disclaimer and any other posted restrictions. The products described herein may not be eligible for sale
      in all jurisdictions or to certain categories of investors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Materials available herein do not constitute investment advice, nor do they have regard to the specific
      investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of any specific recipient. The availability of and
      access to the Materials by you and the content of the Materials are not to be construed as a solicitation or an
      offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial products. No representation, term, condition or warranty,
      either express or implied, is provided in relation to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the Materials,
      nor are they a complete statement of the securities, financial products, markets or developments referred to
      herein. The Materials should not be regarded by recipients as a substitute for the exercise of their own judgement
      or that of any investor. BIS is not under any obligation to update or keep current the information contained
      herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      BIS, its directors, officers, employees or clients may have or have had interests or long or short positions in
      the securities, financial products and/or currencies referred to herein and may, once recipients for whom any
      Materials relating to such securities, financial products and/or currencies are principally intended have or are
      likely to have a reasonable opportunity to act on them, at any time make purchases and/or sales in them as
      principal or agent. In addition, BIS may act or have acted as market-maker in financial products discussed herein.
      Furthermore, BIS may have or have had a relationship with or may provide or have provided investment banking,
      capital markets and/or other services to the relevant companies to which the financial products relate. Employees
      of BIS may serve or have served as officers or directors of the relevant companies. BIS may rely on information
      barriers, such as "Chinese Walls," to control the flow of information contained in one or more areas within BIS
      into other areas, units, groups or affiliates of BIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The securities and/or financial products described herein may not be eligible for sale in all jurisdictions or to
      certain categories of investors. Options, derivative products, loans, managed investment schemes and futures are
      not suitable for all investors, and trading in these products is considered risky. The value of investments may
      fluctuate. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Foreign currency rates of exchange
      may adversely affect the value, price or income of any products mentioned in the Materials. Clients or their
      advisors wishing to effect such transactions should contact their local sales representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the foregoing, the following disclaimer applies where BIS provides an indicative valuation to any
      Client or advisor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any indicative valuation is provided to Client or a financial advisor by BIS for information purposes only and at
      Client's or their advisor’s request. An indicative valuation may also include transactions that Client has entered
      into with other entities within the BIS business group. Indicative valuations are provided without charge and are
      not intended to be used by, and should not be relied upon in any way by, Client or any third party. BIS has no
      obligation to provide indicative valuations to Client or their advisor and may cease doing so at any time in BIS's
      sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicative valuations represent BIS' good faith estimate of the value of the subject transactions as at the date
      indicated and are subject to change without notice. BIS makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
      accuracy or reliability of any indicative valuations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicative valuations are calculated using BIS' standard methodology for estimating the value of transactions of
      that kind. That methodology forms a step in the process of setting BIS's books and records valuations and relies
      on models, empirical data and assumptions. BIS makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy,
      reliability, completeness or appropriateness of BIS' methodology, models or of the underlying data and
      assumptions. Use of different methods, models, data and/or assumptions may yield substantially different results.
      Indicative valuations do not necessarily reflect BIS' internal books and records or its theoretical valuation
      models and may not reflect reserves and other adjustments made to model valuations in BIS' books and records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicative valuations do not constitute an offer by BIS, or represent the price at which BIS would be willing to
      purchase, sell, enter into, assign, terminate or settle any transaction. Indicative valuations are not indicative
      price quotations and do not necessarily reflect such factors as hedging and transaction costs, credit
      considerations, market liquidity and bid-ask spreads, all of which could be relevant in establishing price
      quotations. A valuation estimate for any transaction does not necessarily suggest that a market exists for the
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      No polling of dealers is conducted in determining indicative valuations. BIS' indicative valuations may vary
      significantly from valuation estimates available from other sources and BIS makes no representation or warranty as
      to which any other person may ascribe to the subject transactions.
    </p>
